### WORK FLOW

To keep track of my progress, I recorded each task in my **Notion database** and monitored it on a **Kanban board**. For each task, I created a new branch with the name of the functionality to be built, merged it with the main or parent branch, and then deleted it. This helped me to stay organized and on top of my workflow.

I began with a **mobile-first** approach, structured my SCSS files using a modified **7-1 pattern** and used **BEM** convention to name my classes. I then established global variables for design-related values like colors, font-weights, etc. And created some utility **mixins**, **functions**, and **extends** for common tasks.

Afterwards, I created the main layout components of my webpage, including the header, navigation menu, support section, stats section, and about section. After that, I added the functionality for toggling the bookmark button, then created the select reward popup and reward cards with **custom radio buttons**, a **dropdown** menu, **autofocus** on the pledge input and **scroll into view** functionality, among others, for better UX.

I also created form validations with **custom error messages** and the thank you popup. Then I set up a **global state** to track the userâ€™s pledge data and update the stats (total pledge, total backers, units left, progress bar, etc.) every time he entered a pledge.

> **NOTE**: Throughout the development process, I made it a priority to regularly **refactor** and **add comments** to the code, ensuring it was fast and easy to understand for my future self.
